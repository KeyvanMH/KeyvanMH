# 👋 Hey, I’m Keyvan  

I’m a backend developer who mainly builds stuff with **Laravel** and related tools.  
I like keeping things simple, clean, and practical — no unnecessary fluff, just code that works.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech I work with
- PHP / Laravel  
- MySQL / PostgreSQL  
- REST APIs & a bit of GraphQL  
- Docker (when I feel fancy)  
- Git (yes, I break things and fix them later)

---

## 🌱 Currently
- Sharpening my backend skills  
- Playing around with modern Laravel features  
- Trying to write code that *future me* won’t hate  

---

## 🎯 Other stuff
- Not an open-source celebrity, but I lurk around here  
- Always down to learn something new  
- Lowkey into exploring cool dev tools and frameworks

## 📫 Reach me
- **Email:** keyvan.akbarzadeh.2001@gmail.com  
- Or just drop by my repos and say hi

✨ That’s about it. Just a dev figuring things out.
